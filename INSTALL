0.0) the problem

The majority of the desktop scanners are more or less "passive" devices, say they can be 
queried from a suitable application but they don't do anything themselves. The more expensive
departmental scanners typically include a network interface and the capability to send the scanned 
images via email or place them on a fileserver.

scanbd tries to solve the problem with managing the inexpensive, desktop scanners to make use of the
scanner-buttons they have (in the case, they are supported by sane).
Because the scanners are passive, the scan-software has to poll the buttons on a regularly basis (e.g. all
500ms). For this purpose the software has to open the device ond look for value changes of the buttons.
But if you do so, the devices is locked and no other scan-application (e.g. xsane) can open the device for 
scanning. This is also true for saned, the network scanning daemon. Periodically querying the buttons
and scanning on the same host is mutual exclusive.

0.1) the solution

scanbd (the scanner button daemon) opens and polls the scanner and therefore locks the device. So no other 
application can access the device directly (open the /dev/..., usb). To solve this, we use a so called
"manager-mode" of scanbd: scanbd is configured as a "proxy" to access the scanner and, if another application
tries to use the scanner, the polling is disabled for the time the other scan-application wants to
use the scanner. To make this happen, scanbd is configured instead of saned as the network scanning daemon. If
a scan request arrives to scanbd (in manager-mode) on the sane-port, scanbd stops the polling by sending
a dbus-signal (default) or a posix-signal (SIGUSR1) (signal-mode) to the polling scanbd-daemon. Then it 
starts the real saned which scans and sends the data back to the application. Afterwords the scanbd-manager
restarts the polling by sending another dbus-signal (or the posix-signal SIGUSR2). 

So all applications must be enabled to use network-scanning.

1) build

If you don't want scanbd to use HAL, comment the line in the Makefile (USE_HAL=yes)

make 

copy the executable scanbd and config-file scanbd.conf to useful places
(or use "make install" to copy to /usr/local/etc/scanbd)

2) scanbd_dbus.conf

copy this file into the dbus system-bus configuration directory,
then restart dbus and hald

3) inetd.conf

edit the saned-line to use scanbd as a wrapper, e.g.:

sane-port stream tcp4 nowait saned /usr/local/bin/scanbd scanbd -m -c /usr/local/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf

or 

(if the saned user can't open the devices, e.g. ubuntu)
sane-port stream tcp4 nowait root /usr/local/bin/scanbd scanbd -m -c /usr/local/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf


be sure to give the -m (and perhaps -s) flag to scanbd to enable the "manager-mode" (if you
add also the -s flag the "signal-mode" is used)

4) scanbd.conf

edit the config file (in /usr/local/etc/scanbd)

5) scripts

make some useful scripts

6) sane config

all desktop applications should only get access to the scanners via the net-backend, so edit /etc/sane.d/dll.conf
to only contain the net-backend. Give the net-backend a suitable configuration and add the machines, where the 
scanners (and scanbd) are (this could be also localhost).

If scanbd is running on a desktop machine, saned needs another config which only includes local scanners. Therefore
the env-var SANE_CONFIG_DIR is used in the debian-script and the upstart job. Put the directory of this dll.conf
into this env-var (e.g. /usr/local/etc/scanbd) and remove the net-backend from this config-file.

6) start the scanbd 

e.g.:

export SANE_CONFIG_DIR=/usr/local/etc/scanbd
/usr/local/scanbd -c /usr/local/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf

or use the debian script or the upstart service

Additional hints:

- if there are problems recognizing new / removed devices, it is possible to send scanbd a SIGHUP to reconfigure
  and look for new devices. This can be done via udev-rules.

- be sure to include only the necessary drivers in /etc/saned.d/dll.conf, since scanadf will hang (timeout)

- to test an action for a specific device, use

  scanbd -m -t <device-number> -a <name_of_action>

  e.g. for the first scanner found trigger the action "scan"
  scanbd -m -t 0 -a scan

- problematic desktop scan applications

  most desktop-scan-applications open the scanner but never closes them, therefore the saned is started but 
  never (as long as the scan-application runs) exits. This blocks the scanbd from gaining again the control 
  over the scanner and go on polling.

  The better way to do scanning would be to first get a list of available scanners (scanimage -L or scanadf -L),
  store the list but then close the connection to the found scanners. If a scan is requested, a device from
  the list is choosen, the scan happens and thereafter the connection to the scanner is closed!

  One can achieve this with simple shell scripting:
  a) to get a list of all scanners available: scanimage -L
  b) select a scanner from the list
  c) do the scan: scanadf -d <device>
